1. classes:
 A class is a blueprint for creating objects. 
 The constructor sets up the object's properties like name and age. 
 A method like greet defines actions the object can perform. 

2. arrow_functions:
 const greet = (name) => { ... } is an arrow function named greet that takes an input called name. 
 return helps to return a greeting message using name. 
 console.log(greet("Sir")); calls the function with "Sir" and prints the result. 

3. variables:
 var declares a variable named name. 
 let declares a variable named age. 
 const declares a constant named country. 
 Iupdated the value of age to 24. 
 let allows changing the value after it's declared. 

4. array_methods:
 push() adds an item to the end. 
 pop() removes the last item. 

5. destructuring:
 This extracts values from the array and assigns x = 26, y = 120. 
 This pulls out age and name from the person object and assigns them directly to variables. 

6. modules:
module-import:
 const greet = "Hello there" creates a constant variable named greet with the value "Hello there". 
 export makes this variable available to the module so they can use it. 

module-export:
 import { greet } from "./module-import.js" imports a named export called greet from the file module-import.js. 
 console.log(greet) prints the value of greet to the console. 

7. ternary operator:
 age >= 18 is the condition being checked. 
 If true, isEligible is assigned "You are eligible to drive". 
 If false, it would assign "You are not eligible to drive". 
 console.log(isEligible) prints the result to the console.

8. spread operator:
 ...boys and ...girls expand both arrays into individual elements. 
 allStudents becomes a new array containing all names: ["John", "Daniel", "Queen", "Favour"]
